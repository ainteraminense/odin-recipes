# Odin Project: Recipes

This is my first project after taking up The Odin Project.

Link to project: https://ainteraminense.github.io/odin-recipes/

Tech used: HTML

This project is sole built in html to practice some basic concepts and
html elements, such as images, links and lists. I stuck to the
simplicity of this first project instructions to lay the foundations and
gather momentum and pick up steam.
