    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We make this baked bow tie pasta for Halloween every year at my
    son's request! It's like spaghetti using bow tie pasta. It is mixed
    together with mozzarella cheese cubes and baked in the oven. The bow
    tie pasta is the bats and the stringy, gooey mozzarella cheese is
    the cobwebs!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) jar pasta sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, bring to a
        rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the bow tie pasta and
        return to a boil. Boil pasta, stirring occasionally, until
        cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
        Drain well. </li>
        <li> Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a large skillet
        until beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Stir
        in pasta sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. </li>
        <li> Stir cooked pasta and half of the mozzarella cheese into
        the sauce; toss to combine. Transfer to a 2-quart baking dish.
        Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and
        bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
